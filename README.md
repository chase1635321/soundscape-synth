# Soundscape Synth
A collaborative synth project using JUCE
## Design
 - A basic polyphonic synth. A waveform or two and ADSR.
 - Some reverb
 - A sampler
 - All of that routed through a lowpass filter

## Random long term ideas
 - 4 sound sources: Subtractive synth, sampler, drone sample, sequenced arp sampler or synth
 - All through low pass filter
 - Run on RaPi. Small screen for GUI
 - MIDI control with Akai Professional MPK Mini mkII
